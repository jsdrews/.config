# .config

These are some of my personal config items.

## Nvim

My nvim config is based heavily on [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim/tree/3e55ff1a83dc7a9813d8f2220cefd90b07aacdab)

## Tmux

Currently have base my Tmux config off of [Arkham/dotfiles.nix](https://github.com/Arkham/dotfiles.nix/blob/main/tmux.conf)
