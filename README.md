# .config

These are some of my personal config items.

## Nvim

My nvim config is based heavily on [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim/tree/3e55ff1a83dc7a9813d8f2220cefd90b07aacdab)

## Tmux

### Plugin Management

[TPM](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) is used and the following command will need to be run before installing plugins.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
```

## TODO:

- Look into [tmuxifier](https://github.com/jimeh/tmuxifier)
